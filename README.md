# 23-AutomaticPetFeeder-GwendolineNijssen

The Automatic Pet Feeder is a project that speaks for itself. It’s a pet feeder that will automatically fill up your pet’s food bowl with delicious treats until the bowl is full. By automatically, I mean when a pet comes close enough to the bowl, the bowl will fill up. It’ll also be possible to drop food in the bowl using an online interface (Adafruit IO), or by using Google Assistant and asking it to ‘Feed the pets’. The Automatic Pet Feeder will also inform you if and when your pet is done eating, or if it didn’t finish its food at all.
